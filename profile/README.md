# Tensorium Foundation

The **Tensorium Foundation** is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing research and open-source software in high-performance scientific computing with a focus on numerical relativity.

## Vision

**Empowering science and education through open, efficient, and reproducible computational tools.**

We believe in a transparent, community-driven ecosystem where cutting-edge scientific research and high-performance computing are accessible to everyone.

## Projects

- **Tensorium_lib**  
  A modern, high-performance C++ library for tensor computations, with SIMD and multi-architecture support. Designed for scientific computing, data science, and numerical relativity.

- **Tensorium_MLIR**  
  A custom [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) dialect and pipeline for symbolic tensor computation, code generation, and hardware acceleration in numerical relativity.

- **Tensorium_tex**  
  Tools and parsers for converting LaTeX-based tensor equations into executable code or intermediate representations.

- **Tensorium-simd2gpu**  
  Infrastructure for translating SIMD-optimized code to GPU kernels, enabling performance portability from CPU to GPU.

- **Educational Resources**  
  Open documentation, tutorials, and courses to help students and researchers master high-performance computing, relativity, and scientific programming.
